  \section{The Role of Verbs in Dakota}

Verbs are the single most important type of word in Dakota, and consequently also the most complex.  Like in English, Dakota verbs express actions, but unlike English verbs, they are much more than a simple component of a sentence.  In Dakota, each (fully-inflected) verb constitutes an entire sentence all on its own.  Verbs express not only what action is occuring in a sentence, but also who is performing that action, and to what or for whom that action is being performed.
